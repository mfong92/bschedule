### [www.bschedulelive.com](http://www.bschedulelive.com)

bSchedule was built ontop of a [set of scripts](https://github.com/georgeyiu/schedule-live) 
that extract live enrollment data for Berkeley classes. Those scripts were written 
to quickly aggregate and display data from many pages. By hosting those scripts 
online in the form of a website, we make this functionality readily available.

### Usage
Simply search a department, course number, or full course name.
(department and number). The search is provided directly by [schedule.berkeley.edu](http://schedule.berkeley.edu).
